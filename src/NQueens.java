A list of ways of putting the N Queens
Each way is represented by a list of the Queen's y index
for x indices of 0 to (N - 1)
Example

N = 4, there are two ways of putting 4 queens:

[1, 3, 0, 2] --> the Queen on the first row is at y index 1,
the Queen on the second row is at y index 3,
the Queen on the third row is at y index 0 and
the Queen on the fourth row is at y index 2.

[2, 0, 3, 1] --> the Queen on the first row is at y index 2,
the Queen on the second row is at y index 0,
the Queen on the third row is at y index 3 and
the Queen on the fourth row is at y index 1.
